## 🚀 Low-Code Enthusiast | Platform Engineer | SAP Strategist | Infrastructure Visionary

I’m a Low-Code Platform Initiator and Engineering Specialist, with deep roots in the development and deployment of enterprise-grade applications—especially for state-owned enterprises, public companies, and large private organizations in the Information Technology & Media sectors.

I also have extensive expertise in SAP systems and Enterprise Application Platforms, helping organizations streamline and scale their operations with efficient, low-code-driven solutions.

🔗 I manage an exclusive network of 16M+ private group nodes, each delegatable to unlimited devices via router, with no fees, no data packages, and no subscriptions — a true innovation in decentralized network deployment.
This system empowers scalable communication and processing — without dependency on traditional telecom infrastructures.

# “These are all just facilities and infrastructure that are classified as secondary needs, especially when viewed from the perspective of a small household. The most important thing is the ability to adapt, share, and empower—because technology should serve people, not the other way around.”
